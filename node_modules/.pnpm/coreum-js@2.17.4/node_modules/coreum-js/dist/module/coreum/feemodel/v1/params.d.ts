 * - between "long average block gas" and EscalationStartBlockGas (EscalationStartBlockGas = MaxBlockGas * EscalationStartFraction) where we offer gas price with maximum discount all the time
 * - between EscalationStartBlockGas (EscalationStartBlockGas = MaxBlockGas * EscalationStartFraction) and MaxBlockGas where price goes up rapidly (being an output of a power function) from gas price with maximum discount to MaxGasPrice  (MaxGasPrice = InitialGasPrice * MaxGasMultiplier)
 * - above MaxBlockGas (if it happens for any reason) where price is equal to MaxGasPrice (MaxGasPrice = InitialGasPrice * MaxGasMultiplier)
 *
 * The input (x value) for that function is calculated by taking short block gas average.
 * Price (y value) being an output of the fee model is used as the minimum gas price for next block.
